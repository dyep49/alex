## questions

    do we need a view history of a user, or just
    share/like/etc history?

    can pins be commented on?

    how are we handling who is admin and all?



MAKE PIN FORM SUMIT A SOURCE ID

MAKE SOURCE FORM WORK

REFACTOR(IES) NG FACTORIES


## To do List 

    Carousel is acting kinda weird

    Shares to be in a slider on the user dash

    Make share disappear on click

    Click on sidebar icon to go to page of tags

    Redirect to prevent user from seeing pin that doesn't exist

    Deal with previous/next issues at beginning and end
